## Adam Downey

A recent university student beginning an intensive 12 week software development bootcamp with Makers Academy. Having completed two years of a History and Politics Degree at the University of Reading and being awarded a diploma I am now entering the world of tech. The freedom, co-operation and seemingly endless possibilites that software development offers are the primary attractions to the industry.
